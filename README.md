Habrahabr: Progress Indicator
=============================
The script creates the progress meter fixed nearby the left edge of the screen. It shows the position of the screen center within the post content (e.g. 90% shows that the post is going to end very soon).

It also prepends window title with the length of the post. This feature aims to help in comparing different posts with each other.

For example, `Lorem Ipsum: Dolor Sit Amet` turns into `[5381] Lorem Ipsum: Dolor Sit Amet`.
