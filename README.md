Habrahabr: Post Length
=============================
Prepends window title with the length of the post. This aims to help in comparing different posts with each other.

For example, `Lorem Ipsum: Dolor Sit Amet` turns into `[5381] Lorem Ipsum: Dolor Sit Amet`.

The script also creates the progress meter fixed nearby the left edge of the screen. It shows the position of the screen center within the post content (e.g. 90% shows that the post is going to end very soon).
